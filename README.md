# background-remover
This is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to remove the background from images.
The user can upload an image, preview it using the FileReader API, and process it using either JavaScript Canvas or an external background removal API like remove.bg.
The final image, with a transparent background, can then be downloaded.
The app features a clean and responsive UI and is ideal for personal or demo purposes.
The project includes core files such as index.html, style.css, and script.js.
To run the app, simply clone the repository, open the HTML file in a browser, and start using itâ€”no server setup required.
This project is great for understanding image processing basics and client-side scripting.
